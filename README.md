# Ultimate Neovim Configuration

# Introduction

I've been using vi and vim for over 20 years now. In that time, I've accumulated a lot of
customizations. Eventually, I leveraged pre-baked configs to find the perfect lightweight
IDE including "[The Ultimate Vim Configuration](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)" and
[vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go). These served me well for many years.

When I decided to give [Neovim](https://neovim.io) a spin, I wanted to take the opportunity to
reevaluate some of my choices -- removing plugins I didn't use, updating ones which had
better alternatives (in my opinion), adjusting key bindings and other bits to my taste,
and optimizing the environment for the languages I currently use most. The result is _Yet
Another (Neo)vim Configuration_. Is it the ULTIMATE?  Maybe, if you have similar environmental
and language tastes... If not, it's a good starting point for your own customization!
